	\section*{Question 1 (50 points): Education}

A school counselor was curious about the average of IQ of the students in her school and took a random sample of 25 students' IQ scores. The following is the data set:\\
\vspace{.25cm}

\begin{verbatim}
    y <- c(105, 69, 86, 100, 82, 111, 104, 110, 87, 108, 87, 90, 94, 113, 112, 98, 
    80, 97, 95, 111, 114, 89, 95, 126, 98)
\end{verbatim}  


\begin{enumerate}
	\item Find a 90\% confidence interval for the average student IQ in the school.\\
\begin{verbatim}
CI_lower <- qnorm(0.05, 
                  mean = mean(y), 
                  sd = (sd(y)/sqrt(length(y))) 
)

CI_upper <- qnorm(0.95,
                  mean = mean(y),
                  sd = (sd(y)/sqrt(length(y)))
)

matrix(c(CI_lower, CI_upper), ncol = 2,
       dimnames = list("",c("Lower", "Upper")))


			Lower    Upper
			94.13283 102.7472 
		\end{verbatim}
		\vspace{.5cm}

\vspace{1cm}
	\item Next, the school counselor was curious  whether  the average student IQ in her school is higher than the average IQ score (100) among all the schools in the country.\\ 
	
	\noindent Using the same sample, conduct the appropriate hypothesis test with $\alpha=0.05$.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{verbatim}
    #Question 1 part 2: First visualize the data

class(y)
par("mar")
par(mar=c(1,1,1,1))

#Find the mean of y

meany<- mean(y)

#Find the sum of the demeaned values in this data set. 
#Then find the sum of the errors.

demSum <- y - mean(y)
demSum
sumErrors <- sum(demSum)

SQE <- sumErrors*sumErrors
sum(SQE)

# Use this value to work out the variance in the data. 
# The square root of this is the standard deviation.
s2 <- sum(SQE)/24

standardDeviation <- sqrt(s2)
standardDeviation

# Use your test statistics to work out your t value.
# t = sample mean- population mean divided by SD/sqroot(n-1).
(standardDeviation/sqrt(24))

t<- (meany-100)/2.37

t
> t
[1] -0.6582278

# Our t value is lower that the critical value on our t table.
# We fail to reject the null hypothesis. 
#The mean IQ for the class is not higher than the population mean.
# Conduct a t-test to check your answer.

t.test(y,
       mu = 100, 
       var.equal = FALSE, 
       alternative = "greater", 
       conf.level = .95)

t = -0.59574, df = 24, p-value = 0.7215
alternative hypothesis: true mean is greater than 100
95 percent confidence interval:
 93.95993      Inf

	\section*{Question 2 (50 points): Political Economy}

\noindent Researchers are curious about what affects the amount of money communities spend on addressing homelessness. The following variables constitute our data set about social welfare expenditures in the USA. \\
\vspace{.5cm}


\begin{tabular}{r|l}
	\texttt{State} &\emph{50 states in US} \\
	\texttt{Y} & \emph{per capita expenditure on shelters/housing assistance in state}\\
	\texttt{X1} &\emph{per capita personal income in state} \\
	\texttt{X2} &  \emph{Number of residents per 100,000 that are "financially insecure" in state}\\
	\texttt{X3} &  \emph{Number of people per thousand residing in urban areas in state} \\
	\texttt{Region} &  \emph{1=Northeast, 2= North Central, 3= South, 4=West} \\
\end{tabular}

\vspace{.5cm}
\noindent Explore the \texttt{expenditure} data set and import data into \texttt{R}.

\begin{itemize}

\item
Please plot the relationships among \emph{Y}, \emph{X1}, \emph{X2}, and \emph{X3}? What are the correlations among them (you just need to describe the graph and the relationships among them)?
\item
Please plot the relationship between \emph{Y} and \emph{Region}? On average, which region has the highest per capita expenditure on housing assistance?
\item
\vspace{.5cm}
Please plot the relationship between \emph{Y} and \emph{X1}? Describe this graph and the relationship. Reproduce the above graph including one more variable \emph{Region} and display different regions with different types of symbols and colors.
